# My High-End Rendering Project

Hey, I’m Ashish. So, I’ve been trying to get into **"H"igh "E"nd "R"endering** for a while now. I always thought **C++** was super scary, so I decided to dive into **JavaScript** instead—a language that’s, like, simple? Medium? Total nonsense!

But here I am, serving up this “delicious” project! I mean the effort, of course. Shoutout to **ChatGPT** and **YouTube** for helping me out with this.

I used **HTML canvas** for the graphics, which aren’t mine but are free to use according to the owner.
